# BigWigs_Countdown_Overwatch

**This addon is a BigWigs plugin and requires BigWigs to run.**

The default countdown voice is set in "Sounds" and the pull countdown voice in
"Pull" in the BigWigs options (`/bw`). You can also enable countdown per
ability and change the voice for it in that ability's "Sounds" tab.
