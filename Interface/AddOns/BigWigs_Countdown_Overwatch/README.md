# BigWigs_Countdown_Overwatch

**This addon is a BigWigs plugin and requires BigWigs to run.**

Adds countdown voices from the heroes in Overwatch to BigWigs.

Only the English locale is included. I have the files for the other locales,
but manually splitting them takes forever (and I'm extremely lazy).

The default countdown voice is set in "Sounds" in the BigWigs options (`/bw`).
You can also enable countdown per ability and change the voice for it in that
ability's "Sounds" tab.
