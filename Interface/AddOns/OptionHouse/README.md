OptionHouse
===========

- Enable and disable addons globally, or just for the current character.
- Save sets of enabled addons, and quickly switch back to them later.
- View realtime memory and CPU usage.

You should keep CPU profiling disabled while not actively using it, as it
has a significant effect on the game's overall performance.
